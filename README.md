## Transition from Pandas to Spark Dataframe using Scala.
Code and presentation for the datahack presentation.

### How to run the notebooks

There is a pandas notebook and a spark notebook in the notebooks folder.

For running the pandas notebook you can download anaconda from the downloads page https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and then run `jupyter notebook`.

In case you want to run the spark notebook there is a handy bash script in the repo which you can run using the command `./run.sh`. This script has a docker command and hence please ensure that you are using wifi when running this.
